Task: Tic-Tac-Toe Web App (Task-03)

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game allows two players (or a player vs AI) to play interactively by taking turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid.
It checks for winning combinations, draw conditions, and provides real-time visual feedback for user actions.

The goal is to create an engaging, responsive, and fun web-based game that demonstrates logic implementation and DOM manipulation.
